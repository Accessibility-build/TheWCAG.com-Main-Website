## Conclusion

Accessibility litigation has entered a transformative phase characterized by three converging forces. First, **regulatory frameworks have crystallized around technical standards**—the DOJ's April 2024 Title II rule establishing WCAG 2.1 AA as a binding federal requirement and the European Accessibility Act's June 2025 enforcement date have eliminated ambiguity about what compliance means. Second, **settlement values and jury awards have reached unprecedented levels**, with Fashion Nova's $5.15 million digital settlement, American Airlines' $50 million DOT penalty, and the UK's £4.6 million Wright-Turner award demonstrating the financial stakes of non-compliance. Third, **enforcement mechanisms have diversified** beyond traditional plaintiff litigation to include FTC consumer protection actions (accessiBe), DOJ pattern-or-practice cases (Uber, LA Fitness), and European advocacy group enforcement immediately following regulatory deadlines.

For organizations operating across jurisdictions, the compliance landscape now demands proactive accessibility integration rather than reactive litigation defense. The 41% repeat-lawsuit rate against previously-sued companies in 2024 confirms that superficial remediation invites renewed litigation. Meanwhile, the emergence of AI-assisted pro se filings and the expansion of plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions like Illinois and Minnesota signal continued litigation volume growth through 2025 and beyond.
