Pixelation is more obviously \"censored\" while Gaussian looks more natural. Choose based on your aesthetic preference.\n\n### What blur intensity ensures faces are unrecognizable?\n\nMedium to high intensity ensures non-recognition. Test by viewing the image at different sizes and distances to confirm the face cannot be identified.\n\n### Can I undo the blur after saving?\n\nNo, saving permanently applies the blur. Keep your original image as a backup if you might need an unblurred version.\n\n### Does this comply with GDPR?\n\nProper face blurring can help meet GDPR anonymization requirements. However, consult legal counsel for specific compliance needs as regulations vary.\n\n### Can blurred faces be un-blurred?\n\nProperly applied blur (medium-high intensity) is irreversible. AI cannot reliably reconstruct blurred faces. Light blur may be more vulnerable.\n\n### Should I blur license plates too?\n\nYes, license plates can identify individuals. Use the same selection tools to blur plates in street or parking lot photos.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFace blurring is essential for privacy protection and legal compliance in photography. Our free Face Blur tool provides multiple anonymization methods with adjustable intensity for any privacy need.\n\nProtect privacy in your images with easy-to-use face blurring today.\n\n[Use Face Blur Tool](/tools/edit/face-blur)",
