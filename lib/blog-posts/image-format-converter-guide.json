For best performance, we recommend keeping files under 20MB.\n\n### Will converting affect my image quality?\n\nIt depends on the formats involved. Converting between lossless formats (like PNG to BMP) preserves quality perfectly. Converting to lossy formats (like JPG) may slightly reduce quality, but you can control this with the quality slider.\n\n### Can I convert multiple images at once?\n\nYes, our batch conversion feature allows you to convert multiple images simultaneously with the same settings applied to all files.\n\n### Which format should I choose for web use?\n\nWebP is recommended for modern web use as it offers excellent compression with minimal quality loss.
