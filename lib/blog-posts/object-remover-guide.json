Objects covering less than 20% of the image generally produce best results.\n\n### What about shadows?\n\nInclude shadows in your selection. Otherwise, the removed object may leave a shadow \"ghost\" that looks unnatural.\n\n### Can I remove multiple objects?\n\nYes, select multiple objects in one pass, or process them one at a time for more control.\n\n### Why does the fill look wrong?\n\nComplex backgrounds are challenging. Try adjusting your selection size, or remove in multiple smaller passes. Very uniform backgrounds work best.\n\n### Will it damage surrounding areas?\n\nThe algorithm tries to match surrounding content. Very close proximity to important subjects may require careful selection to avoid affecting them.\n\n### Can I remove people from photos?\n\nYes, people can be removed like any object. Include their full body and shadow for best results.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nObject removal transforms imperfect photos into clean, professional images.
