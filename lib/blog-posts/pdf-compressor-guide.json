PDFs with many images typically compress 40-70%. Text-heavy documents may only reduce 20-30%.\n\n### Will compression affect text quality?\n\nText remains sharp at all compression levels. Only embedded images are reduced in quality.\n\n### Can I compress a PDF multiple times?\n\nYou can, but additional compression after the first pass yields minimal results and may reduce quality further.\n\n### Why is my compressed file still large?\n\nThe PDF may be already optimized, contain mostly vector graphics or text, or have essential high-resolution images.\n\n### Can I compress password-protected PDFs?\n\nPDFs must be unlocked for compression. Remove protection first, compress, then re-apply protection if needed.\n\n### Will links and bookmarks be preserved?\n\nYes, interactive elements like links, bookmarks, and form fields are preserved during compression.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPDF compression is essential for efficient document sharing and storage.
