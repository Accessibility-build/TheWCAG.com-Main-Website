Scanned PDFs contain images of text, not actual text data. For scanned documents, you need OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.\n\n### Why is some text missing from my extraction?\n\nText might be missing if it is embedded as an image, uses an unusual font encoding, or is in a protected layer. Also, some PDFs have text in unexpected reading orders.\n\n### Will the formatting be preserved?\n\nBasic paragraph structure is preserved, but complex formatting like columns, tables, and special layouts may not translate perfectly to plain text.\n\n### Is there a page limit?\n\nNo specific page limit, but very large documents (hundreds of pages) may take longer to process. The 50MB file size limit applies.\n\n### Can I extract text from specific pages only?\n\nCurrently, the tool extracts text from the entire document. For specific pages, consider using our PDF Splitter first to extract needed pages.\n\n### What languages are supported?\n\nThe tool supports text in any language that uses Unicode encoding, including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and more.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nExtracting text from PDFs unlocks content for editing, analysis, and repurposing.
