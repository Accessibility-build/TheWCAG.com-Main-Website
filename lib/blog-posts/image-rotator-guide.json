    "content": "## Introduction\n\nTaking photos in the wrong orientation or receiving images that display incorrectly is a common frustration. Our free online Image Rotator solves this problem instantly, allowing you to rotate images by 90-degree increments or custom angles, plus flip images horizontally or vertically.\n\nAll processing happens in your browser, keeping your images private and secure.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Rotate images by 90 degrees left or right\n- Custom angle rotation for precise adjustments\n- Flip images horizontally or vertically\n- Fix EXIF orientation issues automatically\n- No quality loss for 90-degree rotations\n\n## What is Image Rotation?\n\nImage rotation changes the orientation of an image by turning it around its center point. This is commonly used to:\n\n- Correct photos taken in the wrong orientation\n- Straighten tilted horizons\n- Create artistic effects\n- Match layout requirements\n\n### Rotation vs. Flipping\n\n| Rotation | Flipping |\n|----------|----------|\n| Turns image around center | Mirrors image across axis |\n| Changes orientation angle | Reverses left-right or top-bottom |\n| Maintains image direction | Creates mirror image |\n| Common: 90, 180, 270 degrees | Horizontal or vertical |\n\n## Why Use Our Image Rotator?\n\n### 1. Quick 90-Degree Rotations\n\nSingle-click buttons for the most common rotations. Perfect for fixing photos that display sideways or upside down.\n\n### 2. Custom Angle Support\n\nNeed a specific angle? Enter any degree value for precise rotation. Great for straightening slightly tilted photos.\n\n### 3. Flip Functionality\n\nFlip images horizontally (mirror) or vertically (invert) with one click. Useful for creating symmetrical designs or correcting mirror selfies.\n\n### 4. EXIF Orientation Fix\n\nSome images appear rotated because of EXIF metadata. Our tool can apply the EXIF orientation permanently, fixing display issues across all applications.\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Fixing Phone Photos\n\nSmartphone photos often save in unexpected orientations:\n\n- Landscape photos appearing portrait\n- Upside-down images\n- Sideways selfies\n- Inconsistent orientations in galleries\n\n### Straightening Horizons\n\nSubtle tilts in photos can be distracting:\n\n- Level horizon lines in landscapes\n- Straighten architectural photos\n- Correct scanned documents\n- Align product photography\n\n### Creating Mirror Images\n\nFlipping has practical and creative uses:\n\n- Correct mirror selfies for natural appearance\n- Create symmetrical designs\n- Match image direction for layouts\n- Prepare images for printing transfers\n\n### Batch Orientation Fixes\n\nFix multiple images with the same orientation issue:\n\n- Event photos from same camera\n- Scanned document batches\n- Consistent product shots\n- Gallery preparation\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### Step 1: Upload Your Image\n\nDrag and drop your image or click to browse. Supported formats include JPG, PNG, WebP, and GIF.\n\n### Step 2: Choose Rotation Method\n\n**90-Degree Increments**\n- Click Rotate Left for counter-clockwise rotation\n- Click Rotate Right for clockwise rotation\n- Click multiple times for 180 or 270 degrees\n\n**Custom Angle**\n- Enter a specific degree value (positive for clockwise, negative for counter-clockwise)\n- Useful for straightening slightly tilted images\n\n### Step 3: Flip if Needed\n\n- Click Flip Horizontal to mirror left-to-right\n- Click Flip Vertical to mirror top-to-bottom\n\n### Step 4: Download\n\nPreview your rotated image and click Download. Choose your preferred format if options are available.\n\n## Features and Capabilities\n\n### Rotation Options\n\n| Method | Use Case |\n|--------|----------|\n| 90° Right | Clockwise quarter turn |\n| 90° Left | Counter-clockwise quarter turn |\n| 180° | Upside-down correction |\n| Custom Angle | Horizon straightening |\n\n### Flip Options\n\n| Type | Effect | Common Use |\n|------|--------|------------|\n| Horizontal | Left becomes right | Mirror selfies |\n| Vertical | Top becomes bottom | Reflections |\n\n### Quality Preservation\n\n- Lossless 90-degree rotations (for JPG)\n- High-quality interpolation for custom angles\n- Original resolution maintained\n- Metadata preservation options\n\n## Best Practices and Tips\n\n### When to Use 90-Degree Rotation\n\n- Image displays completely sideways\n- Need to change portrait to landscape or vice versa\n- Fixing batch of similarly oriented images\n- Maximum quality preservation needed\n\n### When to Use Custom Angles\n\n- Horizon is slightly tilted (1-10 degrees typically)\n- Architectural lines need straightening\n- Scanned content is slightly skewed\n- Precise alignment required\n\n### Custom Angle Considerations\n\n- Small angles (under 5 degrees) are usually sufficient\n- Image will be slightly cropped to maintain rectangular shape\n- Quality may be minimally affected\n- Use grid overlay if available for alignment\n\n### Flip Best Practices\n\n**When to flip horizontally:**\n- Mirror selfies that look unnatural\n- Images for transfer printing (t-shirts, etc.)\n- Creating symmetrical compositions\n- Matching direction with other images\n\n**When NOT to flip:**\n- Images with readable text\n- Photos where left/right matters\n- Documentary or journalistic images\n- Images with asymmetrical subjects\n\n## Understanding EXIF Orientation\n\n### What is EXIF Orientation?\n\nEXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata includes an orientation flag that tells software how to display the image. Issues occur when:\n\n- Software ignores EXIF data\n- EXIF data is stripped during upload\n- Different apps interpret orientation differently\n\n### Common Symptoms\n\n- Image appears correctly in one app but rotated in another\n- Uploaded images display sideways on websites\n- Thumbnail shows different orientation than full image\n\n### The Solution\n\nOur tool can apply EXIF orientation to the actual pixel data, making the correct orientation permanent regardless of what software displays the image.\n\n## Rotation Quality Explained\n\n### 90-Degree Rotations\n\n90, 180, and 270-degree rotations are lossless for most formats because:\n\n- Pixels are simply rearranged\n- No interpolation required\n- No new pixels created\n- Original quality perfectly preserved\n\n### Custom Angle Rotations\n\nNon-90-degree rotations require interpolation:\n\n- New pixel positions calculated\n- Some quality loss possible\n- Edges may need cropping\n- Best for small angle adjustments\n\n## Comparison with Alternatives\n\n| Feature | Our Tool | Photos App | Photoshop |\n|---------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Cost | Free | Free (with OS) | Paid |\n| Custom Angles | Yes | Limited | Yes |\n| Batch Support | Yes | Limited | Yes |\n| Browser-based | Yes | No | No |\n| EXIF Fix | Yes | Sometimes | Yes |\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Does rotation affect image quality?\n\n90-degree rotations are lossless and do not affect quality. Custom angle rotations may have minimal quality impact due to pixel interpolation.\n\n### Why do my photos appear rotated incorrectly?\n\nThis usually happens because of EXIF orientation metadata. Some software reads this data and rotates the display, while others ignore it. Our tool can fix this permanently.\n\n### Can I rotate animated GIFs?\n\nYes, our tool supports GIF rotation, including animated GIFs. All frames will be rotated together.\n\n### What is the difference between rotate and flip?\n\nRotation turns the image around its center point (like turning a page). Flipping creates a mirror image across an axis (like seeing your reflection).\n\n### Will the file size change after rotation?\n\nFile size usually remains similar after 90-degree rotations. Custom angle rotations may slightly increase file size due to the processing involved.\n\n### Can I undo a rotation?\n\nBefore downloading, you can reset to the original. After downloading, you would need to rotate in the opposite direction to reverse the change.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFixing image orientation does not have to be complicated. Our free online Image Rotator provides quick 90-degree rotations, custom angle adjustments, and flip options to solve any orientation problem.\n\nWhether you are fixing a batch of sideways phone photos or straightening a slightly tilted horizon, our tool makes it simple and keeps your images private.\n\n[Use Image Rotator](/tools/convert/image-rotator)",
