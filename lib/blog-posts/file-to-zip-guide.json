Files never leave your device or get uploaded to servers.\n\n### What happens if I close the tab?\n\nProcessing stops if you close the tab before completion. The ZIP file is only available until you download it.\n\n### Can I password-protect the ZIP?\n\nPassword protection is not currently available. Create the ZIP here and add a password using desktop software if needed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCreating ZIP files organizes and compresses your files for easier sharing and storage.
