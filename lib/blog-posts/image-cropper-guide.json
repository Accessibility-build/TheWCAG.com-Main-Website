Always keep your original image as a backup.\n\n### What happens to image quality when I crop?\n\nCropping itself does not reduce quality of the remaining portion. However, the cropped image will have fewer pixels, which may affect how large it can be displayed.\n\n### Can I crop to exact pixel dimensions?\n\nOur tool uses aspect ratios for cropping. After cropping, you can use our Image Resizer to set exact pixel dimensions.\n\n### Does cropping change the file format?\n\nYou can choose your output format (JPG or PNG) when downloading. PNG is recommended for images with transparency.\n\n### Can I make a circular crop?\n\nOur tool creates rectangular crops. For circular crops, create a square crop (1:1) and use image editing software to apply a circular mask.\n\n### What is the maximum file size I can crop?\n\nImages up to 50MB are supported for cropping. Larger images may take longer to process.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCropping is essential for creating well-composed, platform-appropriate images. Our free online Image Cropper provides all the tools you need for perfect crops every time, from preset aspect ratios to precise manual selection.\n\nStart creating beautifully cropped images today with our easy-to-use, browser-based tool.\n\n[Use Image Cropper](/tools/convert/image-cropper)",
