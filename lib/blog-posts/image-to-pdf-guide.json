For smaller file sizes with acceptable quality, compress images before conversion.\n\n### Can I add text or annotations?\n\nThis tool converts images to PDF without modification. For adding text, use our PDF Editor after conversion or prepare images with text before converting.\n\n### What image formats are supported?\n\nJPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP formats are supported. For best results with photos, use JPG. For images with transparency, use PNG.\n\n### Is there a limit on the number of images?\n\nThere is no strict limit, but very large documents may take longer to process. For best performance, keep documents under 100 pages.\n\n### Can I password-protect the PDF?\n\nThe basic conversion does not include password protection. You can add protection using PDF editing software after download.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nConverting images to PDF creates professional, shareable documents perfect for portfolios, scanned documents, and multi-image collections.
